# odin-recipes -- Project 1 in Odin-Project - HTML Centric Lesson

## From the Introduction: 

It's time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished. 

But it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.  
  
## What was practiced/learned: 

Learned that I accidentially already knew / used some CSS in the past

What was excersized was using html tags to accomplish writing a barebones website
